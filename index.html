    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Abstract</h2>

        <p>The Internet serves as a vital platform for information access and global connectivity. Widespread online engagement offers unprecedented opportunities to study human behavior at scale, yet researchers face significant ethical and technical barriers when attempting to collect data for academic studies.</p>

        <p>In particular, major social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have progressively restricted access to their official Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which previously served as primary tools for researchers to create customized datasets from specific platforms for studying online content production and engagement behavior. Content exposure and app usage behavior on mobile phones is an even rarer source of data despite a large chunk of online activity taking place on these devices.</p>

        <p>This satellite introduces the <a href="https://nationalinternetobservatory.org" target="_blank">National Internet Observatory (NIO)</a>, an alternative data collection framework and infrastructure designed to help researchers study online behavior, with a particular focus on content viewing---the predominant form of online activity.</p>
        
        <p>The satellite will present NIO's informed data donation process, participant demographics and behavioral traces,  secure computing infrastructure and pathways for data access, and examples of analyses and innovative research with this new source of data for the network science community.</p>

        <p>The satellite will incorporate interactive activities and hands-on sessions with real network datasets that demonstrate NIO's capabilities for enabling novel cross-disciplinary and cross-platform research across web and social network environments.</p>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>The satellite is designed for academic researchers from all disciplines represented at the NetSci conference. There are <b>no formal prerequisites</b> for participation. We encourage anyone interested in online activity data collection and research to join.</p>
        
        <p>While a background in digital behavioral research helps participants better understand the challenges and opportunities that NIO presents, it is not required to learn about this new data collection infrastructure. Introductory data science skills in Python/R will help with the hands-on session where participants explore an aggregated network dataset on their own devices. </p>
    </section>

    <section id="details">
        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>The satellite is 3.5 hours long, designed as one continuous half-day session. There will be a formal 30-minute coffee break at 10:30 AM, designed to be in-sync with the schedule for the rest of the satellites and conference programming that day.</p>

        </ol>

        <h2>Participant Capacity</h2>
        <p>Due to space constraints, up to <b>30 participants</b> can be accommodated for this satellite, on a <b>first-come, first-serve basis!</b> <a href="https://forms.gle/sgjVPMSNWYeYh2K49" target="_blank">Signing up</a> to express interest in attending this satellite and learning about NIO can also help us assess capacity constraints and adjust. </p>
